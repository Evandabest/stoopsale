What is this website?
This is an app where you can sell your trash and find your next treasure. Stoop Sale Sniper or SSS for short offers a market place where people can post the items they want to sell. SSS also allows users to place bids on items they see. The bid isn't final but it gives the seller an idea of what they can except and what a ballpark budget for buyers. Sellers can specify if their item is First come first serve (FCFS). If they do mark their item as FCFS, they aren't as strict on the bid price and is willing to let go of the item to the first person who shows up. If they don't decide to mark FCFS, they are more strong about their asking price and potentially the bid price.
